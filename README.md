# Exercise 5.5-Networking

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A simple networked game

To play, run two instances of this exercise in Godot. In one press the Host Game button. Then press the Join Game button in the second window. The position of the players will be relayed over the network (over localhost) from one copy to the other. Each player can be controlled (using WASD) depending on which window is selected.
